# Designing a Secure Network Topology
In this lab I used a software called GNS3 and designed a very basic network consisting of 2 switches, 2 VLANs, a firewall residing on the outside of the entire network
and a DMZ and on the opposite side of the firewall. The purpose of the lab was to practice a very rudimentary concept that every great NetSec engineer needs to know
which is defense in depth. 
# Network Creation
- Beginning using GNS3 I create 4 diferent work stations and assign their IP addresses. I create two different switches to seperate both work stations 1-2 and 3-4.

- Once the network is created and IP addresses have been assigned. I ping the paired work stations to validate that they are connected in the same network. For example,
  vWorkstation 1-2 etc.
