- **Scan Configuration:** Configured OpenVAS with default settings to identify vulnerabilities in the target VM.
- **Target Specification:** The Metasploit VM was chosen as the target due to its known vulnerabilities.
- **Scan Execution:** The scan was run to detect and enumerate security flaws.
## Report Findings
- **Findings:** A report was generated highlighting critical, high, medium, and low-severity vulnerabilities.
- **Remediation Suggestions:** OpenVAS provided recommendations to mitigate detected vulnerabilities.

## Discussion and Conclusion

In this lab, I learned how to effectively utilize a vulnerability scanner such as OpenVAS to find possible points of entry in a system. Now that I have this information, I can utilize it in future labs to exploit the VM and gain root access through different means.

Key Takeaways:

- Understanding how OpenVAS scans and detects vulnerabilities.
- Interpreting vulnerability reports and their severity levels.
- Learning how to configure and execute a scan properly.
- Recognizing the importance of vulnerability management in cybersecurity.
