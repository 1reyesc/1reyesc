# Firewall and Network Security Lab Report

## Introduction
In this lab, we are going to view the inbound and outbound firewall rules for a Windows network. With these rules in mind, we will use a tool to scan for threats and then reverse engineer these threats.

## Task 1: Examine a pfSense Firewall Configuration
**Objective:** Review the firewall configuration in preparation for a pen-testing situation.

- **Step 1:** WAN rules table

## Task 2: Conduct a Penetration Test on the Network
**Objective:** Work through the attacker kill chain to perform a penetration test.

- **Step 3:** Identified vulnerabilities  

## Task 3: Conduct a Port Scan on the Network
#### Objective: Take the side of a Red Team member and assess the external view of the network.

- **Step 5:** Pinging the host but it appears to be down?

## Task 4: Conduct a Vulnerability Scan on the Network
**Objective:** Use another tool similar to Nessus to conduct a vulnerability scan.

- **Step 7:** OpenVAS scan detailed results

## Task 5: Research DMZ Deployment Best Practices
**Objective:** Research DMZ best practices.

### Best Practices:
1. Limit the amount of internet-facing port exposure on critical resources.
2. Restrict exposed ports to only required IP addresses.
3. Update the public IP range in active use regularly.

**Common Mistake:**  
- Allowing traffic from the LAN to the DMZ to be accessible from the WAN.

## Task 6: Conduct a Penetration Test on the DMZ
**Objective:** Use the `AttackLinux01` machine to perform an `nmap` scan on `corptech`.

- **Step 7:** Identify open ports for the web server and DMZ firewall.

- **Step 9:** Conduct vulnerability scans.

## Task 7: Recommend Changes to the DMZ
**Objective:** Based on observations from penetration testing, recommend improvements to the DMZ.

- **Recommended Change:** Restrict the NTP mode so that unauthorized queries cannot be made.

## Conclusion
## Conclusion

Through this lab, I gained valuable hands-on experience in assessing and securing a network using various security tools and methodologies. By examining the pfSense firewall configuration, I understood the importance of properly setting up firewall rules to control traffic flow and reduce attack surfaces. Conducting penetration tests and vulnerability scans allowed me to analyze network security from both an attacker’s and defender’s perspective, reinforcing the need for proactive security measures.  

Additionally, researching DMZ best practices highlighted the importance of minimizing exposed ports, restricting access, and maintaining up-to-date configurations to protect critical systems. By performing a penetration test on the DMZ and identifying vulnerabilities, I recognized how attackers could exploit misconfigurations, emphasizing the necessity of continuous monitoring and security hardening.
