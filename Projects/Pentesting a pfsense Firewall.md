# Firewall and Network Security Lab Report

## Introduction
In this lab, we are going to view the inbound and outbound firewall rules for a Windows network. With these rules in mind, we will use a tool to scan for threats and then reverse engineer these threats.

## Task 1: Examine a pfSense Firewall Configuration
**Objective:** Review the firewall configuration in preparation for a pen-testing situation.

- **Step 1:** WAN rules table

## Task 2: Conduct a Penetration Test on the Network
**Objective:** Work through the attacker kill chain to perform a penetration test.

- **Step 2:** Pentest scan results
- **Step 3:** Identified vulnerabilities

## Task 3: Conduct a Port Scan on the Network
**Objective:** Take the side of a Red Team member and assess the external view of the network.

- **Step 4:** `traceroute` command
- **Step 5:** Pinging the host but it appears to be down

## Task 4: Conduct a Vulnerability Scan on the Network
**Objective:** Use another tool similar to Nessus to conduct a vulnerability scan.

- **Step 6:** OpenVAS scan report
- **Step 7:** OpenVAS scan detailed results

## Task 5: Research DMZ Deployment Best Practices
**Objective:** Research DMZ best practices.

### Best Practices:
1. Limit the amount of internet-facing port exposure on critical resources.
2. Restrict exposed ports to only required IP addresses.
3. Update the public IP range in active use regularly.

**Common Mistake:**  
- Allowing traffic from the LAN to the DMZ to be accessible from the WAN.

## Task 6: Conduct a Penetration Test on the DMZ
**Objective:** Use the `AttackLinux01` machine to perform an `nmap` scan on `corptech`.

- **Step 7:** Identify open ports for the web server and DMZ firewall.
- **Step 9:** Conduct vulnerability scans.

## Task 7: Recommend Changes to the DMZ
**Objective:** Based on observations from penetration testing, recommend improvements to the DMZ.

- **Recommended Change:** Restrict the NTP mode so that unauthorized queries cannot be made.
